        <h1>Welcome to BLS API How To Guide</h1>
        <p>by Tatsiana Clifton</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class = "cont">
            <p>Thank you for visiting. This guide was written to help you get familiar with the BLS Public Data API. If you would like to find official documentation for the BLS API please go to <a href = "http://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm">the BLS developer's site.</a></p>
            <p>The BLS Public Data API provides access to employment data. The retrieved information is presented in JSON format.</p>
            <p>There exists two versions for the BLS API. The current guide focuses on version 1.0. This version does not require registration, it is free and open to the public. However, it has some limitations comparing to version 2.0. We will not see a comparison of the two versions here. You can easily find this information on the official web site with the link that was provided above. You do not need to obtain any keys to start using version 1.0 of the BLS API.</p>
            <p>The official documentation includes the sample code for some popular programming languages. However, it does not cover how to make requests using Node.js and Express. This guide is written to show how to work with the BSL API using mentioned technologies.</p>
            <p>The following areas will be covered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href = "section1.html">using single series signature;</a></li>
                <li><a href = "section2.html">using multiple series signature;</a></li>
                <li><a href = "section3.html">using single or multiple series signature, specifying years;</a></li>
                <li><a href = "conclusion.html">example of a small application;</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will see the code examples for every section. Hopefully, you find this guide useful.</p>
